# First Kotlin App
Inspired by the book [Kotlin For Android Developers](https://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-developers-book/), I'm working on a sample app that showcases core kotlin features and its utilization in Android. (In Progress)

### Explored Features
- Data classes to parse Web Service API Response
- Anko extensions for Android
- Map,Filter,Reduce methods
- Lambda Expressions
- newInstance fragment pattern
- creating singleton by using delegated properties
